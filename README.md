Business Context
Gamers' Arena is a website that provides information about video games. It keeps track of the games that have been released and their sales across various platforms and genres. Different genres, such as RPGs, shooters, multiplayer, action, and so on, would appeal to different audiences. Gamers' Arena has now implemented a feature on their website that allows gamers to subscribe to their platform on a month-to-month basis. They can play a limited number of games as long as they have a subscription.

Objective
As an analytics lead, you must design an interactive dashboard that helps the director of the company make a decision on a new sales model (a subscription model) that will attract more gamers to our platform. There are multiple questions to be answered in order to make the decision on the subscription model. For example, which games need to be given for the subscription and what would be the duration? In order to answer these questions, a dashboard needs to be created with the following information:

1. What is the total number of games? What is the total global sales in millions of dollars (USD)?What is the average CriticScore? What is the total number of users?
2. Which are the top-N games, top-N platforms, and top-N genres based upon GlobalSales?
3. How have GlobalSales been distributed across platforms and genres?
4. Which are the top-N games based upon UserScore, CriticScore, and the number of users rated?
5. What are the top N games based on the number of users rated and what is the average UserScore for these games?
